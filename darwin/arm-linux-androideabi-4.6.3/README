NOTICE:

OSX by default is missing elf.h in /usr/include/

The linux kenrel be default builds some tools on the local system that
require elf.h thus may return an error due to the missing file

The fix is to manually install the elf.h in this package to your system

sudo cp elf.h /usr/include/elf.h
